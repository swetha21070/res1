    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am an 18-year-old with a passion for learning, creativity, and growth. Having studied in three different schools across two countries, I have gained a diverse perspective and adaptability from a young age. I began my educational journey at Park Gate Primary School in London before moving to Chennai, where I attended SBOA School and Junior College, and later Mylapore Vidya Mandir. Each school played a vital role in shaping my academic foundation and personality. My love for dogs and music adds balance to my life, offering me joy and inspiration beyond academics. My curiosity and drive have always pushed me to explore and excel in every endeavor I undertake.</p>
    <p>Academically, I am a Computer Science graduate from Rajalakshmi Engineering College with a deep-seated passion for technology and innovation. I have honed my skills in Java, Python, C, and HTML, equipping myself with the tools necessary to thrive in the tech industry. I’ve also authored five research papers, all published in reputable journals, demonstrating my analytical capabilities and commitment to pushing the boundaries of knowledge. From my first year in college, I actively participated in over 30 technical competitions, embracing challenges and consistently striving for excellence. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the value of perseverance and teamwork. My journey in computer science has been fueled by my love for problem-solving and my eagerness to stay at the forefront of technological advancements.</p>
    <p>Beyond academics, I have always been a proactive and passionate individual. My journey as a journalist began at a young age, with my articles being published and paid for in the popular Indian magazine Vikatan. This early exposure to writing not only nurtured my creativity but also instilled in me a sense of responsibility and professionalism. Whether it’s writing, coding, or exploring new hobbies, I approach everything with enthusiasm and dedication. My multifaceted interests, combined with my technical expertise and love for learning, make me a well-rounded individual ready to contribute meaningfully to any team or project. With a keen eye for detail, a relentless drive to improve, and a commitment to excellence, I am prepared to make a positive impact in all my future endeavors.
